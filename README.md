## Contribution Guide

Starting a new ticket:

1. Create a new branch from `production` with branch name `pr-<issue nr.>`
2. Focus development on just the task for that issue nr.
3. Open a pull request towards `production` branch

When you stop developing for the day but the task is not finished yet, be sure to:

1. Make a "WIP" commit
2. Sync with Github
3. Open a "draft" pull request from your branch towards `production`

Remember we're using `npm` (as opposed to `yarn`)

## Project setup

npm i
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
